### AGRIATRA

Agriculture is the backbone of Indian Economy. Around 85 percent of the population, is directly or indirectly dependent on Agriculture and around 26 percent of India’s GDP is contributed by Agriculture. Adding additional income generating activities to existing agriculture model would certainly increase contribution of agriculture in the national GDP. 

Hence, We propose a Agro-tourism based idea **Agriatra** to provide an allied financial gain generation methods with agriculture.

Benefits to farmers ?

- Cash flow during the off-season
- Diverse income streams
- Sell their “experience” of agricultural and its related practices.
- Revenue through products grown in their farms.
- Popularise and generate income through traditional art forms.

How it can help boost Indian Economy? ( A real-life problem)

One of the leading sectors in current global business is tourism, responsible for significant proportion of world production, trade, employment and investment, helping inflow of foreign exchange and FDI. Tourism Sector accounted for 39M jobs (8% of total employment) in Financial Year 2020 and is expected to touch around 53M by end of the Financial year 2029.

**Current Scenario of Agritourism in India**

Most of the agrotourism in india has been based on the north-eastern states of India like Assam and Mizoram and the other states with **poor farmers like Orissa, Bihar remains untouched** in the field of tourism, even after holding a rich genre of agriculture in these states. These has been some platforms but defined for some states, and **no one stop solution of agriculture to all states**. Eg. Agrotourism for Assam, Agrotourism for Maharashtra

**OUR BUSINESS MODEL**

We will work on commission basis, and the remaining equity will be arranged accordingly in between farmers and guides.

In order to sustain better and grow further on business, we are planning to use the existing infrastructure of the locals rather than building infrastructure for accommodation. In this way, the high percent of the total price that is generally involved in accommodation will be given to farmers.

In this way, we can scale the business very well even with the very least of initial investment.
